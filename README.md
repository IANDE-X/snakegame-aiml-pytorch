# Teach AI To Play Snake! Reinforcement Learning With PyTorch and Pygame

In this Python Reinforcement Learning Tutorial series we teach an AI to play Snake! We build everything from scratch using Pygame and PyTorch. The tutorial consists of 4 parts:


- Part 3: Implement the agent that controls the game.
- Part 4: Implement the neural network to predict the moves and train it.
